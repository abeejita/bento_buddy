<h1 align="center">Bento Buddy</h1>
Have you ever been in the following situation: Returning from work, opening the door, seeing the kitchen, feeling hungry, opening the fridge, and seeing a variety of ingredients but with no idea what to do or cook with them? We present Bento Buddy, a python executable that can become your next cooking partner. Why? Because it will have a repertoire of cooking recipes that, depending on the ingredients available in your fridge, will offer some recommendations on delicious dishes with the appropriate instructions on how to cook them. Not only acting as a partner, but as your own cooking book from which you can save recipes for later if you have the available ingredients. It is particularly useful for when little to no creativity, but the motivation to go ahead on your own cooking path. 
But what about those who have special or some food restrictions? No need to worry. The interface lets you know the caloric information that the cooked dish will have, as well as limit the recipes shown for healthier or options that are well within those specified food restrictions.

With a simple interface, the Python application uses the Tkinter module together with the Spponacle free API to allow the users to add ingredients through a button available and with another button filter for recipes that have those ingredients. From that interface, you can either click on the recipe to know more or go back through clicking buttons. Finally, at the recipe view, you can observe the nutritional values, the ingredients, the steps to cook and how the dish should look like. Here is a simple graphical representation.
